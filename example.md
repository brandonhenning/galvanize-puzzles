## The Polya Steps

### 1. Understand the Problem
Before beginning this puzzle, I identified the three inputs as name, superhero and age. The output will be a completed matrix with the name, superhero and age identified.
#### I know:
- There are three friends, three superheroes and three ages
- Each name will be associated with one superhero and one age (there will be no duplicates)
- This puzzle can be solved with the given clues

### 2. Devise a Plan
- My plan is to create a grid system to keep track of the data I find in the clues.
- I will run through the clues one at a time and repeat that process until I have a solution.

### 3. Carry out the Plan
- First clue: Bryan likes Spiderman

- Second clue: Tony doesn't like Superman
  - This means that Tony must like Batman
  - If Tony likes Batman, and Bryan likes Spiderman then Sean must like Superman

### 4. Look Back
- I am glad that I reflected on how solve-able this puzzle was before beginning, I started confident that I could be successful
- This puzzle only required one round of clues
- The clues were very straight forward
- I found the matrix to be very helpful in keeping track of not only what I knew from clues, but what I could deduce from the facts (using x's)
- Knowing that there would be no duplicates across the data allowed me to make assumptions which led to the completed puzzle
- In the future, I will follow the Polya steps to break down problems and approach the solution in a planned out comprehensive manner
